KineticaFS is a region-aware file lifecycle manager for S3-based storage. It tracks file usage across regions, migrates
hot files closer to clients, and safely removes unused ones using reference-counting and GC.

## ✨ Features

- 📦 **S3-compatible**: Works with any S3-compatible storage backend (AWS, MinIO, Wasabi, etc.)
- 🌍 **Region-aware**: Detects file access patterns and migrates "hot" files closer to clients
- 🧠 **Smart pointers**: Tracks file references in your system to prevent premature deletion
- ♻️ **Garbage collection**: Removes unreferenced or expired files safely and automatically

## 🚀 Quick Start
